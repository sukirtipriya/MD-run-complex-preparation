ANTECHAMBER/GAFF - Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) which is supposed to
provide parameters suitable for small molecules that are compatible with the AMBER protein/nucleic acid force fields. It is available either together with AMBER, or through the antechamber package, which is also distributed separately. There are scripts available for converting AMBER systems (set up, for example, with GAFF) to GROMACS (amb2gmx.pl, or
ACPYPE), but they do require AmberTools installation to work.
